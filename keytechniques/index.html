        <h3>Backstitch</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Backstitch</strong> secures the seam that you have just sewn so that it doesn’t unravel by securing the thread in place. To <strong>backstitch</strong>:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Sew a few stitches then stop. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Now press/hold the reverse button on your sewing machine and sew back over the stitches you have just sewn. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Stop and sew forward over the stiches you have already sewn continuing to sew as per the instructions.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you reach the end of your sewing, repeat step 2 and 3 but this time stop at the end of the stitches. Finally snip the thread.

        <h3>Hidden Stitch</h3>
        <p>A hidden stitch closes up a seam without showing any stitches. To sew using hidden stitch you need to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Double thread your needle and tie a knot at the end</li>
          <li>Sew the needle through the fabric from the inside to the outside until the knot catches in place</li>
          <li>Sew in to the opposite fabric, directly across from your first stitch</li>
          <li>Sew back out of the same side of the fabric a couple of mm along</li>
          <li>Repeat this from one side of fabric to the other, along the length of the opening; as you sew the       sides</li> should pull together to close the gap!
          <li>When you have sewn along the opening, tie off your last stitch as close to the fabric as possible.      Secure</li> the thread by sending your needle back inside your project, next to the knot, and pull it out about 3cm away.
          <li>Cut the thread</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Straight Stitch</h3>
        <p>
          Straight stitch is essentially what it says, a row of straight stitches one after the other. For the make your own craft kits, sew the stitches close together without leaving much of a gap.

        <h3>Seam allowance</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>seam allowance</strong> is the area between the edge of the material and the stitches which hold the material together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: If you are advised to leave a <strong>seam allowance</strong> of 1cm this means you will sew your row of stitches 1cm from the edge of the material.
        </p>

        <h3>Notches</h3>
        <p>
          Notches are cut around the curve in a sewing project so that when you turn it the right way round, it isn’t bulky. Cut a series of notches, spaced at regular intervals around the curves of the heart making sure not to snip too close to the stitches.

        <h3>Clip the point/clip the corner</h3>
        <p>
          There are various ways of ‘<strong>clipping</strong>’ in sewing depending on the kind of point or edge that you are using.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the bunting and cushion projects, the type of <strong>clipping</strong> used is the same. Firstly, trim the corner of the point being careful not to cut the stitches themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Secondly trim from the edges to the point at an angle to create a sharper point.
