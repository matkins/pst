    <h2>Sewing Terms/Technique Guide</h2>
    <h3>Backstitch</h3>
    <p>
      Backstitch secures the seam that you have just sewn so that it doesn’t unravel by securing the thread in place. To backstitch:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Sew a few stitches then stop. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Now press/hold the reverse button on your sewing machine and sew back over the stitches you have just sewn. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Stop and sew forward over the stiches you have already sewn continuing to sew as per the instructions.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      When you reach the end of your sewing, repeat step 2 and 3 but this time stop at the end of the stitches. Finally snip the thread.
    </p>
    <h3>Clip the point/clip the corner</h3>
    <p>
      There are various ways of ‘clipping’ in sewing depending on the kind of point or edge that you are using.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the bunting and cushion projects, the type of clipping used is the same. Firstly, trim the corner of the point being careful not to cut the stitches themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly trim from the edges to the point at an angle to create a sharper point.
    </p>
    <h3>Seam allowance</h3>
    <p>
      The seam allowance is the area between the edge of the material and the stitches which hold the material together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: If you are advised to leave a seam allowance of 1cm this means you will sew your row of stitches 1cm from the edge of the material.
